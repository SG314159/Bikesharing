# Bikesharing
Challenge 14 for UT Bootcamp - Tableau Public


# Overview 
## Purpose of Analysis
This analysis gives information about the CitiBike ridesharing data for August 2019 in New York City. The visualizations here provide insight about how customers use the bikes, where the bikes are used, and information about the customers themselves. 

## Visualization
The visualization exists on a Tableau Public page [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.g4118/viz/NYCBikesharing_16266497629650/NYCBikesharing?publish=yes). There are 4 pages in the story named NYC Bikesharing.




# Results
## Story Page 1: Customer Information
This page outlines some information about customers and usage habits. The top chart is a simple pie chart showing that 65% of rides were completed by men, 25% by women, and 10% by a person whose gender is unknown. The bottom chart compares the usage patterns of regular customers vs subscribers across genders. More rides are done by subscribers than by non-subscribers, and more by males than females. Thursday is the day with the most number of rides.

## Story Page 2: Checkout Times
This page shows the length of time that each rider used the bike. Only usage times from 0 minutes to 3 hours are shown, left to right. The top chart shows that most rides are less than 20 minutes long. Then it levels off quickly as we move out to 3 hour checkout times. The bottom chart breaks out the top chart by gender. Here, we see the same patterns, with women perhaps having the most rides (the mode, indicated by the high peak) be slightly shorter time length than men.

## Story Page 3: Usage Patterns
This page shows how many trips occurred across different days of the week and during times of the day. Darker colors are higher counts. The top chart has all riders and shows that the most number of rides occur during morning rush hour and evening rush hour. There is also decent use on the weekends between 11am and 4pm. The data shows less usage on Wednesday afternoons compared to other afternoons. The bottom chart breaks out this data by gender. As you can see, each gender exhibits individually the same usage patterns although females have fewer rides than males, as mentioned earlier.

## Story Page 4: Location Analysis
This page contains two maps of the NYC area. The top map shows the most popular starting locations for bikesharing, and the bottom map shows the most popular ending locations. You can see that the busiest locations are on Manhattan island, particularly in the lower half of the island. The most active stops on the west side of the island seem to correspond to where the Lincoln Tunnel and the Holand Tunnel are located. The busy location towards the east side of the island about halfway up corresponds to Grand Central Terminal. As you can see, approximately the same popularity exists for most starting and ending locations.
